We implore You to look in favour upon name and name who enter into wedlock today, blessed them and help them to daily live in your fear and love not to allow any room for anger and discord. Grant them the grace to over come difficult situations in life. Help them to bring up their children in accordance with your will. Grant that we all shall live faithful and obedient lives. And at the end we shall remain blessed through your beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one true God, world without end. Amen.\nPastor: Beloved in Jesus Christ, let us hear what our Lord said in the Holy Scripture on the estate of holy matrimony. The Lord God ordained holy wedlock from the beginning saying, it is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him. Of the sanctity and inviolability of this holy estate, our Lord Jesus Christ has said: Have you not read that He who made them from the beginning made them male and female, saying for this reason shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man put asunder.\nOur Saviour Himself graced with His presence the wedding of Cana and there revealed His glory. Saint Paul spoke of the sacred and mysterious union of Christ and His bride the Church, as the exalted and holy example of the union between a man and his wife. Therefore you shall know that this holy estate is well-pleasing to God and has His blessing.\nPastor: Let us hear what Saint Paul speaking through the Holy Spirit says: Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the Church and gave Himself up for her. He who loves his wife loves himself, after all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church..\nIn like manner, let us hear what Saint Peter speaking through the Holy Spirit says, wives, in the same way your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes. Instead it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and a quiet spirit which is of great worth in God s sight. Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gifts of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.",

Bear one another s burden and so fulfill the law of Christ. Put on therefore as God s elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering, forbearing one another and forgiving one another, even as the Lord forgave you, so also do you; and above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.\n(The couple shall kneel and the pastor with the laying on of hands shall say :)\nOur heavenly father vouchsafe unto this man and his wife your grace, blessing and prosperity, both in body and soul. Grant that they may love one another faithfully, and serve you sincerely in all things, that they may live as your dear children, and at last be with you in the everlasting habitations.\nOur Father Who art in heaven, Hallowed be Your Name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven, give us this day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.\nPeace be unto you. Amen.\nThe Burial of the Dead\nIn the Church",

        "text": "Lord God Almighty our heavenly Father, Who by the death of your Son has destroyed sin and death, and by His resurrection has restored innocence and everlasting life, in order that we might be delivered from the dominions of the devil and our mortal bodies be raised up from the dead. Grant that with our whole heart we may confidently believe this, and finally with all your Saints share in the joyful resurrection of the just. Through Jesus Christ your beloved Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one true God, world without end. Amen.\nBeloved in the Lord, let us hear the testimony of Holy Scripture on life and death:\nLuke 12:35-37a: Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, like people waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks, they can immediately open the door for him. It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes.\nJohn 8:51 Very truly, I tell you, whoever keeps my word will never see death.\nJob 1:21 Naked I came from my mother s womb, and naked shall I return, the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord.\nRomans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\nJohn 14:19b. Because I live, you also will live.\n(For burial of children, it is advisable to read Mark 10:13-16):- And they brought little children unto Him that He should touch them, and the disciples rebuked them. But when Jesus saw it, He was moved with indignation, and said unto them, suffer the little children come unto me, forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God. Truly I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein. And He took them in His arms, and blessed them, laying His hands upon them.\n(Then a brief exhortation shall follow, then prayer and a hymn after which people will head for the grave yard)\nAt the Grave",

They will be his people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the first things have passed away. He who overcomes will inherit these things, I will be their God, and they will be my children.\n1 Corinthians 15:53-57 For this perishable body must put on imperishability, and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will be fulfilled: Death has been swallowed up in victory. O death where is your victory? O death where is your sting? The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(The pastor then moves closer to the grave and says :)\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.\n(There after the pastor shall throw earth on the coffin three times, while saying).\nOut of dust you were taken\nUnto dust you shall return\nAnd out of dust you shall rise again",
