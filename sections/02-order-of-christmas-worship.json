We render our worship and praise unto You. For our eyes have seen Your salvation: which You have prepared before the face of all people, a light to lighten the people.\nCongregation: Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah to God our Saviour.\nMinister: Our loving heavenly Father, we thank You for loving the world that You gave Your only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour, we thank You that You did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited, but emptied Yourself taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness. Lord Holy Spirit we thank you that You opened our eyes through the light of Your Word to understand that Jesus is the Son of God, the only Saviour. O gracious God, help us to once again hear the gospel joyful news, that, today in the city of David is born to you a Saviour, he is Christ the Lord. Grant that we celebrate this Christmas with others in brotherly love. We ask all these in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.\nCongregation: A-men, A-men, A-men",
